# The server side spawns one thread for each expected connection from
# the client-side, opens and registers the whole provided memory.
# Each of the server threads accepts a connection on the dedicated port
# (different for each and every working thread), accepts and executes flush
# requests, and sends back a flush response for each of the requests.
# When the client is done it sends the termination notice to the server's thread.
